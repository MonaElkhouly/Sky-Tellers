This project introduces space weather concepts to kids using three interactive flipping books. Each book is narrated by a different character:
- Astronaut
- Pilot
- Photographer

At the end, a short quiz helps reinforce what kids learned.

## Purpose
The website makes complex space topics simple, engaging, and easy to remember. It supports:

- Three interactive flipping books
- Character-based storytelling
- Simple explanations of real space phenomena (auroras, solar storms, satellites)
- End-of-story quiz for revision

## How It Works
1. The user selects a character.
2. They flip through a digital book with visuals and animation.
3. Each character explains a space weather topic.
4. A quiz appears after all stories are completed.

## Benefits
- Makes science fun and accessible
- Improves memory through interaction
- Connects real-world concepts to what kids see in media

## Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI tools were used to:
- Create animations
- Develop and simplify the story text

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Turn.js (for flipping book effects)
- AI-based design and writing tools

Our project aims to **educate children about space weather** in a fun and engaging way.  

We achieve this through:  
- **Relatable characters** that guide children through the concepts.  
- A **user-friendly website** designed to capture attention and encourage interaction.  
- Spark excitement about space and technology
- Support early STEM education in a fun and visual way
- Teach kids scientific concepts through story-based learning

### Why Flipbooks?

To make learning even more interactive, we incorporated **flipbooks** within the website:  
- They provide the **feel of reading a book** gradually.  
- They keep children engaged **without getting bored**, especially as many of todayâ€™s younger generations are less inclined toward traditional books.  

By combining **interactive characters, flipbooks, and an intuitive interface**, we aim to create an **educational experience that is both entertaining and memorable**.

## Future Improvements
- Add narration or sound effects
- Introduce more characters or topics
- Include progress tracking or badges
