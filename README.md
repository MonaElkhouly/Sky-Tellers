# Space Weather Kids Website

An interactive educational website designed to teach children about space weather through storytelling and quizzes.

## Overview
This project introduces space weather concepts to kids using three interactive flipping books. Each book is narrated by a different character:
- Astronaut
- Pilot
- Photographer

At the end, a short quiz helps reinforce what kids learned.

## Purpose
The website makes complex space topics simple, engaging, and easy to remember. It supports:
- Curiosity about space
- Early interest in STEM
- Imagination and critical thinking

## Features
- Three interactive flipping books
- Character-based storytelling
- Simple explanations of real space phenomena (auroras, solar storms, satellites)
- End-of-story quiz for revision

## How It Works
1. The user selects a character.
2. They flip through a digital book with visuals and animation.
3. Each character explains a space weather topic.
4. A quiz appears after all stories are completed.

## Benefits
- Makes science fun and accessible
- Improves memory through interaction
- Connects real-world concepts to what kids see in media

## Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI tools were used to:
- Create animations
- Develop and simplify the story text

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Turn.js (for flipping book effects)
- AI-based design and writing tools

## Goals
- Teach kids scientific concepts through story-based learning
- Spark excitement about space and technology
- Support early STEM education in a fun and visual way

## Future Improvements
- Add narration or sound effects
- Introduce more characters or topics
- Include progress tracking or badges
